#### 2019 vs 2018 stores data
After some cleaning, there are some id_local stores in 2018 that are not in 2019 (12 out of 147318).  

**Assumption 1**:
- In v1 I am going to drop them and will analyze them further in future product increments.

#### 2017 stores data
There is a difference of 114 id_local between 2017 locals files (OPEN DATA Locales201708.csv) and activities file (OPEN DATA Locales-Epigrafes201711.csv.  

**Assumption 2**: 
- In v1, I will take OPEN DATA Locales-Epigrafes201711.csv as the reference. In future version I will clean it over.
